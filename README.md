# Password_Docker
It is a NodeJs based project and for database i used mongodb to store data and ejs is used in making views.
In it a user can signup and login and jsonwebtoken is used for authentication in this project. If an user signup/login then they can save their email and password with website name and url of site.
Basically i made this project to keep safe my all passwords and user credentials because as a human it is not possible for us to keep remember of all id and password.
